# `crclart` LaTeX class

## Installation 

To install the class, simply copy-paste the contents of the `source` folder 
into the folder where your `.tex` is. Otherwise, if you have cloned 
this repo, you can create a symbolic link to it inside your local `texmf` folder 
where LaTeX finds local packages :

    mkdir ~/texmf/tex/latex
    ln -s <path to your crclart clone>/source ~/texmf/tex/latex/crclart

## Usage

See the example in the `template` folder to see how you can use the class to
write your article following the CRCL journal [submission
guidelines](https://journalcrcl.org/crcl/about/submissions).
